## Hackathons
(Order: latest most recent, tools used, and role included)
**Legora x OpenAI** - PhD & Thesis contact automation tool. Only finalist with a non-profit product. Data Engineering, Retrieval, Web Scraping with Python and SQL.
**Nordic Software Summit** - "Tone"
**Antler VC x KTH AI Society** - "Tone"
**Project Europe x Project Lovable x ElevenLabs** - "Tone", <1% acceptance rate, won ElevenLabs prize. Sales copilot for the entire sales experience (pre, live, post call): Ideation, Leadership, Backend, and Agentic logic with TypeScript.
**AWS x Couchbase** - "SmartPyLogger", my first Python package for middleware and logging at the same time. Backend API and data management implemented in Python, and request-sniffing written in Golang. 
**Google** - Total fluke and purely vibecoded. Poor event organization & management due to hackathon startup "Cillers".
**Mashup x Neo4j x Google** - "Bull AI", one of my favorites to date. We built a data pipeline to merge bull semen data from 2 poorly designed German websites into one Postgres database and generate PDFs based on them for each bull. My job was to implement web scraping and Data Engineering.
**Azure x SSE Business Lab** - "Achki", a YOLOv8-based surveillance tool that, given streams of video, can monitor up to n amount of streams. My job was to implement ffmpeg streaming, distributed inference via Azure, and cloud deployment. 
**Modal x Founders House** - "Logistix" - Super shitty GPT wrapper for a logistics optimization tool I had an idea to make. Ebay for logistics tasks. Trial by fire.
